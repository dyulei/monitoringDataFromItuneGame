A fantastic engineer, he was always buried in his work, always coming up with new ideas and inventions that as a child held you wide-eyed in awe.\n\nNow, after many years, you return to the house that holds so many fond memories for you, with a promise from Grandpa to show you something truly amazing. You can't even begin to imagine what it could be!\n\nIt's a dark and stormy night as you arrive at Grisly Manor.

Clues abound, and as each puzzle is solved, the solution to others present themselves. As well as new puzzles, of course.\n\nGrandpa obviously spent a lot of time making sure that nobody could solve the myriad of puzzles strewn about the house. Nobody but you, his favorite grandchild\u2026\n\nCan you solve the mystery of Grisly Manor?\n\nFeatures: \nInspired by classic point and click adventure games!\nBeautiful graphics that draw you into this mesmerizing adventure!\nLots of items to collect and puzzles to solve!\nFantastic soundtrack and sound effects!\nAuto saves your position.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "娱乐", "探险游戏", "家庭游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6016", "7002", "7009"], "releaseDate":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Joe Kauffman", "bundleId":"com.firemaplegames.com", "trackId":384282298, "trackName":"The Secret of Grisly Manor", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"Graphic updates", "minimumOsVersion":"4.3", "formattedPrice":"¥6.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"The Secret of Grisly Manor", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/the-secret-of-grisly-manor/id384282298?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"9+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a1980.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/e7/ad/e4/e7ade4b0-f466-60db-ada0-f83ffda2ad9d/mzl.rxsmaoxb.jpg", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"13829562", "sellerUrl":"http://www.firemaplegames.com/tsogm.html", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":85, "trackContentRating":"9+", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":445}]
