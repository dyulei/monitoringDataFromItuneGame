"description":"You are marooned on the shores of an infinite blocky world. Explore, mine resources, craft tools and weapons, hunt, make traps and grow plants. Build a shelter to survive nights and share your worlds online. Ride horses or camels and herd cattle. Blast your way through the rock with explosives. Build complex electric devices. Possibilities are infinite in this sandbox survival and construction game.\n\nThis is the twenty sixth release of Survivalcraft, and it finally introduces custom skins, which can be downloaded from community content. Check out the new awesome explosions engine that will let you obliterate anything in a shower of fiery debris. Build and load cannons. Wield a crossbow and shoot explosive bolts or set the world afire with incendiary arrows. Use stone fences to beautify your builds.\n\nSurvivalcraft brings features you love in the PC version of the most popular block game to your mobile device: infinite worlds, caves, logic elements (electricity), weather, boats, ridable animals, explosions and many more. It does so while maintaining its own realistic, survival-themed style.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nWebsite: http://kaalus.wordpress.com\n\nUpdate history so far:\n- 1.0 (initial release, 16 Nov 2011)\n- 1.1 (screenshots, torches, lamps, tools, controls sensitivity, recipaedia)\n- 1.2 (sneaking, stairs, slabs, doors, ladders, snow, ice, christmas tree)\n- 1.3 (basalt, limestone, marble, furnace)\n- 1.4 (new world format, clay, bricks)\n- 1.5 (birds, weapons, throwing, food, eating)\n- 1.6 (emergency bugfix release)\n- 1.7 (trapdoors, water animations, snowballs, traps, wildboars, game modes)\n- 1.8 (buckets, water physics, magma, world properties, view angles)\n- 1.9 (Dropbox, fences, upside-down stairs and slabs)\n- 1.10 (optimizations, bulls, signs, sulphur, saltpeter, adventure mode)\n- 1.11 (explosives, fire, matches, magma as fluid)\n- 1.12 (wolves, cows, milk, diamonds, flat terrain, controls improvements)\n- 1.13 (creature spawners, eggs, saplings, compass, thermometer, grass spreading)\n- 1.14 (emergency bugfix release, hygrometer, sharper text)\n- 1.15 (big performance improvements, bears, machetes, adventure restart, cacti)\n- 1.16 (smoother framerate, polar bears, paint, falling blocks, environment modes)\n- 1.17 (3rd person view, 3d tools, creature shadows, physics optimizations)\n- 1.18 (rain, snow, thunderstorms, thawing/freezing, werewolves, pumpkins)\n- 1.19 (electricity, new UI, new recipaedia, new help, germanium + lots more)\n- 1.20 (community content, better caves, creative options, SD card)\n- 1.21 (fish, horseriding, electricity improvements, camels, leather + lots more)\n- 1.22 (survival, farming, boats, islands, more painting, pathfinding, rhinos and many other animals)\n- 1.23 (content rating, larger visibility range, analog electrics, halloween special, donkeys, bass)\n- 1.24 (bows and arrows, shooting target, reindeer, tigers, iron fences, ivy, feathers, string)\n- 1.25 (custom skins, new explosions engine, bombs, crossbows, fire arrows, new UI, stone fences)", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "娱乐", "动作游戏", "探险游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6016", "7001", "7002"], "releaseDate":"2013-04-26T16:17:05Z", "sellerName":"Igor Kalicinski", "bundleId":"com.candyrufusgames.survivalcraft", "trackId":622613679, "trackName":"Survivalcraft", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014,
