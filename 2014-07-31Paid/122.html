"description":"Orbitum is a hypnotic rhythm-based reflex game of light and darkness. \n\n\"It's surprisingly difficult to leave alone - very hypnotic.\" - Chris Priestman, Pocket Gamer\n\n\"A stylishly stripped-back and curiously serene arcade experience that has you running on a particularly hazardous cosmic treadmill.\" - Jon Mundy, Pocket Gamer\n\n\"It\u2019s the perfect little game to pick up and play when you have a spare moment.\" - Christine Chan, AppAdvice\n\nThe rules are simple: switch the orbits, survive against all odds and keep calm. A tap is all it takes to get through. But you\u2019ll discover less is more when your dexterity starts to be put to the test. Starting off fairly simple and gradually building up into something quite fiendish, the game will keep your grey matter ticking over in unison with the stimulating techno sounds. Appearing out of nowhere and vanishing in darkness, the round-dancing shapes will make your head swim, hands sweat and teeth clench. But as you get the rhythm you will see that there's nothing more satisfying than the feeling of genuine achievement after you've nailed another hellish level. \n\nRecommended hardware:\niPhone 4 and higher, iPod touch 5th gen, iPad mini, iPad 2 or higher. For the best possible Orbitum experience, use these recommended devices.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏"], "genreIds":["6014"], "releaseDate":"2014-07-02T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Happymagenta Ltd.", "bundleId":"com.happymagenta.circles", "trackId":889940865, "trackName":"Orbitum", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "minimumOsVersion":"5.0", "formattedPrice":"¥6.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"Orbitum", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"19012774", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":79, "artworkUrl100":"http://a1518.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/df/fb/56/dffb56bb-1890-21da-a91c-418832dac1f2/mzl.knkcklli.png", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/orbitum/id889940865?mt=8&uo=4", "trackContentRating":"4+", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":79}]
