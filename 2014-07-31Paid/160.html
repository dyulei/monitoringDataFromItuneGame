"description":"Partia is a SRPG (Strategy Role-playing) video game inspired by Fire Emblem and Tear Ring Saga series. In a high fantasy setting, the game will take players through an adventure where magic and sword collide and friendship and betrayal intertwine.\n\nIn version 1.0.3\n- Graphics Optimized for iPhone 5 and iPod Touch 5!\n- Arena now has 2 vs 2 and 2 vs 1 mode (PVP coming soon at 1.0.4)\n- Game is now fully D-Pad controllable at Intermission (iCade support will be in at 1.0.4)\n- You can heal units at Inn using Crowns and Potions\n- Introducing 'horse rule' that increases attack power with distance traveled\n- New unit type Ballista (Only at Stage 5 though)\n-Minimum iOS version is now 4.3 meaning iPhone 3G support is discontinued.\n\nIn version 1.0.2\n- Improved enemy A.I.\n- Faster gameplay option\n- Faster dialog option\n- Single tap menu button option\n\nYou can access the options either in-game or at the title screen menu.\n\nThank you guys for your reviews and suggestions. Good ones encourage us and bad ones humble us.\n\nI am constantly fixing bugs that are brought up to me and trying to change things that bother people. It takes time since I am just one guy (Imago Software is only two guys) dealing with many issues. Still things will improve in future updates that I'm working on.\n\nMeanwhile, obviously this is a paid game and I don't want to disappoint or cheat people out of their money.\n\nHere's a gameplay video from TouchArcade's Sanuku (Thank you!):\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3O9tw2L5Wg&feature=plcp\n\nThis may help with your purchase decision! Also our own video that include game tutorials are at\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/Playimago\n\n@Matthew Haralson\nYes, the minor character development was very weak. More dialogs will be written in part of effort to more complete game experience!\n\n@Tony Peniyoung\nI was going to answer your concern but didn't really get the message!\n\n@Grievlocke\nWow, having big battle animations will be really cool. Number 1 in my wish list too. Simply there was no budget and it looks like there will be no budget in the future, either- looking at the sales.\n\n@Many who wanted more stages\nI had random map generation for more guild quests, but I couldn't get the quality right yet. Random really never worked with the element of strategy, and became just a brute fighting.\nPartia 2 was planned for 25 stages that wraps up the story, but at 600 games sold, well, I wonder if I could ever get enough budget.\n\n@ErnieBernie876\nI know it is not as convenient as having a restart button, but you could suspend the game and load the last save data to restart the stage from the beginning.\n\n@frozencracker\nIt would be a bug if you have an attack option without having a valid target, but I can't seem to reproduce it. To cancel the attack while targeting, you could press 'B' button (that's the inside button) or you could choose a target then select No.\n\nI will try my best to answer any question!
