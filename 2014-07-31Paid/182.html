"description":"Perloo is a geometric fairy tale. Abandon your assumptions, solve a series of mind-bending challenges and find your way to the true world.\n\nPerloo is a compact one-of-a-kind puzzle adventure that challenges you to think outside of your comfort zone. See how the real world influences the virtual one \u2013 and vice versa. Perloo plays with physics, quantum mechanics, philosophy, optics and perception to create a world with rules of its own.\n\nPerloo is a ludic experiment, perhaps even a philosophical proposition. But most of all, Perloo is an excruciatingly hard puzzle game. You might cry.\n\n\u2023  Nine mind-bending puzzles that will leave you pulling your hair out\n\u2023  Never know what\u2019s next with challenges that force you to think outside the black (or white, or champagne) box\n\u2023  Automatically saves your game for the illusion of progress\n\u2023  Original soundtrack by Ella Empress and the Layers of Reality\n\u2023  Supported by philosophers\n\n\n■ Requirements ■\nPerloo requires an iPhone 4 or newer.\nThe game is not supported on either iPod Touch or iPad!\n\n\n■ Questions? ■\nContact us via support@perceptor.nl\nFollow @perceptornl on Twitter\nLike PerceptorNL on Facebook\n\n\n■ About Perceptor ■\nPerceptor is a design studio with a broad outlook.
