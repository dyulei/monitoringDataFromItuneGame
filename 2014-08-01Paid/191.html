"description":"** Now with ONLINE MULTIPLAYER! **\n\nThe official Jenga® game is here! Designed in consultation with Leslie Scott, the original creator of Jenga®, Jenga for iPhone/iPod touch lets you take the tower building experience anywhere.\n\nSLASHGEAR\n\"Completely excellent! Hours of fun!\"\n\nPOCKETGAMER\n\"Pitch-perfect physics. Thoroughly enjoyable!\"\n\nTUAW\n\"Gorgeous graphics. VERY addictive. The only reason I stopped was my battery was drained!\"\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@NMGames)\nGet the latest news on our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/naturalmotiongames)\n________________________________________\n\nREALISTIC PHYSICS\nReal-time 3D physics simulation, authentically recreating the behavior of a real wooden Jenga tower. Each block is realistically affected by the surrounding blocks, recreating the same strategic depth as the original game.\n\nTOUCH CONTROL\nAnyone who\u2019s played Jenga knows how delicate your touch needs to be. The iPhone\u2019s super-accurate touch screen gives you the control you\u2019ll need to go for world record heights (incidentally\u2026 the record is 40 2/3 layers!). Blocks can be teased out using a mix of gentle tapping and drag controls. It\u2019s easy to begin with, but you\u2019ll soon find it tough when the pressure is on and the tower is wobbling!\n\nGYROSCOPE INTEGRATION\nView the tower just as you would in real life by moving the device around it. The built-in gyroscopic mechanisms allow for unprecedented control of your viewpoint. Study the structure of the blocks to plan your next move.\n\nSOCIAL GAMEPLAY\nObviously the best part of Jenga is putting off your friends as they are making their move. The four-player Pass\u2019n\u2019Play mode truly reproduces the nail-biting tension of the real thing\u2026 but you can play it anywhere!\nAnd what\u2019s more, Jenga for iPhone lets you compare your current tower height against that of friends around the world \u2013 while you play! A little friendly competition is the best motivator...\n\nARCADE MODE\nJenga on iPhone introduces a brand new mode: Jenga Arcade. Match colors for extra points and score multipliers by moving fast \u2013 but don\u2019t topple the tower! While you play, you earn coins which you can spend on special boosts like collapse reverse, multipliers, and wildcards. It\u2019s fast and frantic\u2026 totally turning Jenga on its head.\n\nSTUNNING VISUALS\nJenga for iPhone is beautiful. With full Retina display support, you won\u2019t see a single pixel. Advanced wood shaders make the tower pop out and let you gauge its stability. And everything is set in beautiful environments, rivalling the quality of modern games consoles.\n\nGAME CENTER INTEGRATION\nLike all titles from NaturalMotion Games, Jenga fully supports Apple\u2019s Game Center including leaderboards, achievements and easy friend comparisons.\n\nAUTHENTICITY\nDesigned in consultation with Leslie Scott, the inventor of Jenga, to create the most authentic Jenga experience ever.\n________________________________________\n\n** DON\u2019T MISS OUR OTHER GAMES!!
