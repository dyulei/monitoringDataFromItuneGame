A beautifully illustrated card puzzle game by the makers of Cleopatra's Pyramid. \n\nKEY FEATURES OF THE GAME: \n* Hours of entertaining brain training \n* Maya Pyramid is a challenging variation of the \"Pyramid\" solitaire game \n* More than 70 unique level designs in 28 stages in Adventure mode \n* Build your very own Maya Pyramid out of 12 beautiful pyramid blocks \n* Experience the Maya jungle at night - depending on the time you play \n* Play the interactive tutorial to learn the basics of Maya Pyramid \n* Beautiful Maya-themed artwork \n\n\nENTERTAINING BRAIN TRAINING \nGo along on an expedition, combine the right cards, and solve all puzzles to create your very own Maya Pyramid. Overgrown by lianas, the gold of the Maya has been hidden in the jungle for centuries. Now it's up to you to find your way into the secret treasure chamber. \n\nA TRICKY SOLITAIRE CARD GAME VARIATION \nMaya Pyramid is a variation of the \"Pyramid\" solitaire game. This variation requires you to form card pyramids by marking groups of cards which add up to 11. \n\n\u201cMatch cards up to add to 11, revealing other cards and then repeat. In actuality, it\u2019s a nail-biting good time. The game is fast-paced and exciting and younger players won\u2019t realize they\u2019re building strong math skills in the process. It\u2019s a wonderful example of the \u201ceasy to grasp, difficult to master\u201d philosophy that makes for a good game.\" (Chris Morris, Journalist)\n\n\"This FreeCell related game requires skill and patience to win.
