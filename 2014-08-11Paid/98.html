"description":"Take the fight into space in this action/adventure space shooter rogue-like!\n\nYour mission is simple: destroy all the things in space. All the things. Whether it's a stray enemy fighter, a mysterious alien carrier, a monstrous enemy base, or a random asteroid, you're going to have to take it down. And it will explode. Oh, yes, it will explode, and it will explode gloriously as every explosion in Space Colors is like a snowflake: no two are ever the same.\n\nYour mission: venture into space, survive as long as possible, and make beautiful explosions out of all who oppose you.\n\n* EXPLOSIONS: So many explosions, each rendered in the unique style of Space Colors.\n* CHARACTER PROGRESSION: Sure, you'll find pick-ups here and there to help you along the way, but you can also access the in-game shop to purchase permanent upgrades that will give you an edge in every new playthrough to come. \n* REPLAYABILITY: No two games of Space Colors will ever play the same way. Missions, enemies, rewards, and the galaxy as a whole are randomly generated every time you start a new game. \n* INTUITIVE CONTROLS: No virtual joysticks or complicated touch gestures; just tap to move, tap an enemy to target, or tap and hold to continuously move in a given direction.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "动作游戏", "探险游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "7001", "7002"], "releaseDate":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Team Chaos LLC", "bundleId":"com.teamchaos.spacecolors", "trackId":903112173, "trackName":"Space Colors", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "minimumOsVersion":"4.3", "formattedPrice":"¥6.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"Space Colors", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/space-colors/id903112173?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"9+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a789.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/06/4c/50/064c50e8-7090-09b6-c61c-a9926bcd5456/mzl.bxcoqcbv.png", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"33748452", "sellerUrl":"http://teamchaos.com/game/space-colors/", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":5.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":3, "trackContentRating":"9+"}]
