"description":"#1 MUSIC GAME IN OVER 60 COUNTRIES !!! \n\n***** Great Game - I have been playing this game for a week, I can not stop... Really addictive. Oct 15, 2013 by Elmango98 - United States\n\n***** Great game! - I've got blisters on me fingers! Aug 13, 2013 by eyeland - United States\n\n***** Audio Ninja is awesome! - This game is amazing! I find it frustrating when I keep getting stuck on a particular part *cough* 98% Super Level 1 *cough* but I can't stop playing it! Great rhythm game :) Aug 24, 2013 by XG4mer360 - United Kingdom\n\nAudio Ninja is a highly addictive rhythm title that puts you in control of Ninjipu, a young ninja who is having trouble finding his own path. But when he is given an awesome pair of headphones by Bill Merchanto, a mysterious man from the future, he gains the power to defeat his enemies by following the rhythm! \n\nExperience intense action by defeating hordes of clones created by Clone Evil, while your brain cells dance to the beat of outstanding soundtracks! \n\nHave you noticed how, when you listen to music, you unconsciously follow the rhythm by moving your head, or even tapping your fingers on the table? \nThis game takes advantage of the latter, allowing you to defeat Ninjipu\u2019s enemies while feeling the beat. You will be immersed in a cartoon-like environment with simple, yet beautiful, character design, along with funny and innovative animations, all driven by a very cool musical experience. \n\n\nFeatures: \n\u2022 4 Worlds with different environments and cool soundtracks. \n\u2022 62 Levels. \n\u2022 12 Super Levels. \n\u2022 Survival mode based on 3 world themes. \n\u2022 Alter time with faster, slower and even reversed gameplay! \n\u2022 Crush your enemies by using a tractor... among other power-ups brought by Bill from the future!

Time travel is tricky that way.)", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "音乐", "探险游戏", "音乐"], "genreIds":["6014", "6011", "7002", "7011"], "releaseDate":"2013-08-07T16:03:50Z", "sellerName":"BRAINZ SAS", "bundleId":"co.brainz.audioninja", "trackId":656833778, "trackName":"Audio Ninja", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014,
