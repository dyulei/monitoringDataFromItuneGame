"description":"As you slowly regain consciousness your eyes begin to focus on your surroundings. You find yourself alone in an unfamiliar room with no memory of how you came to be there. Moonlight streams through a small barred window illuminating the musty stale air. How long have you been here? Worn stone steps lead up to a wooden door, you grip the cold metal handle and turn but it\u2019s locked from the other side - are you a prisoner? can you escape?\n\nPrepare to explore a mysterious manor house and the fog shrouded moors which encompass it. Solve puzzles and search for clues to discover the manor\u2019s secrets and ultimately escape from Darkmoor. This is a point and click adventure designed exclusively for mobile platforms.\n\n-----\nIf you're experiencing any issues with Darkmoor Manor please contact us (the developers) directly.
