"description":"#1 Game in 32 countries!!!\n* 4.5 stars rating by players!\nThe Action is exhilirating in the game that is rank #1 in 32 countries. Based on epic Gladiator movies and games of the past, I,Gladiator brings exciting and fast-paced gameplay to mobile.\nRufus is a Pawn between two warring Roman gods. For Rufus to gain control of his own fate and to get revenge, he has to start at the bottom and fight his way through a series of increasingly difficult tournaments in different locations. You play Rufus and you are his destiny!\nYou attack from different angles based on easy to use screen gestures and controls. You can also string together combos when you swipe continuously (like in a figure-eight pattern) until you run out of stamina. Swiping down kicks your opponent in the gut, knocking him down if unblocked and giving you a breather. Holding down the shield button can parry incoming attacks, while holding and swiping allows you to dodge anything that can't be blocked.\n+ Now CROSS-PLATFORM MULTIPLAYER\n+ 80 ACTION PACKED LEVELS \n+ OVER 100 HISTORICALLY ACCURATE WEAPONS AND ARMOR TO UNLOCK \n+ 20 ADRENALIN DRIVEN HOURS OF GAMEPLAY \n+ MULTIPLAYER!
