"description":"A surreal thriller in which the written word is your map, as well as your narrator.\n\nDEVICE 6 plays with the conventions of games and literature, entwines story with geography and blends puzzle and novella, to draw players into an intriguing mystery of technology and neuroscience.\n\nAnna wakes up in a castle on a remote island, with little recollection of how she got there. All she remembers is an unusually unpleasant doll.\n\nWhy are there two identical castles on the island? Who is the mysterious man in the bowler hat? And above all, what is the purpose of the tests Anna is put through?\n\nRead, listen and peek into three-dimensional photographs to solve the bizarre mysteries of DEVICE 6.\n\n\n\"DEVICE 6 is designed to linger in the mind long after the last code has been cracked and the last sentence read. Spy stories - even traditional ones - often haunt their readers' dreams once they've been completed. It's only appropriate, really. Is that a final full-stop or a microdot? Is this the end of the affair or an invitation to go deeper?\"\nEurogamer - 9/10\n\n\"In using its text both as narrative and as geography \u2013 and through its impressively restrained use of illustration and sound \u2013 it generates an almost unrivalled sense of place. It isn\u2019t embarrassed to allow Device 6 to be a game when it needs to be, and yet it knows precisely when to let the story take over. The result is a sharp, striking mystery that is at once provocative, extraordinarily stylish and altogether essential\"\nEDGE - 9/10\n\n\"In turning a text adventure into a world map, Simogo has resurrected a long-dead genre with style and confidence. Great presentation and brilliant puzzles complete a stellar package\"\nPocketgamer \u2013 9/10\n\n\"Ever exceeding expectations, the developer has followed up one of 2013\u2032s highlights with another title that can be classed as such. With a compelling story that keeps you guessing, and a pin-point utilisation of the platform, Device 6 is an accomplishment in games design, mobile or otherwise\"\nGod is a Geek - 9/10\n\n\"DEVICE 6 not only explores the boundaries of narrative storytelling, it also demonstrates the creative potential of touchscreen gaming\"\nAppspy \u2013 5/5\n\n\"Simogo\u2019s doing something few others are doing, and it\u2019s wonderful that someone is both providing great experiences and testing the limits of interactive media\"\n148apps - 5/5\n\n\"An ingenious slice of puzzling adventure that's as imaginative as it is stylish\"\nModojo - 4.5/5", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "图书", "探险游戏", "角色扮演游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6018", "7002", "7014"], "releaseDate":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Simogo Handelsbolag", "bundleId":"com.simogo.devicesix", "trackId":680366065, "trackName":"DEVICE 6", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"- Optimisation for older devices.\n- Fixed typo in Chapter 4.\n- Added feature to reset progress via iOS Settings.", "minimumOsVersion":"5.1", "formattedPrice":"¥25.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"DEVICE 6", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"137388482", "sellerUrl":"http://www.device6.com", "contentAdvisoryRating":"12+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":30, "artworkUrl100":"http://a548.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/aa/9e/5e/aa9e5e1a-f2ef-5151-cd00-de6f1697f380/mzl.kwmwqgox.png", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/device-6/id680366065?mt=8&uo=4", "trackContentRating":"12+", "averageUserRating":5.0, "userRatingCount":40}]
