I'm not spending hours and hours senselessly grinding, and I'm not cooking fake food until my eyes bleed. The mix of action and simulation feels right. The pacing is good.\u201d -toucharcade.com\n\n\u201cIt's a massive game, with a seriously smart idea that has been executed well. If you're hooked by RPGs and find simulations addictive, this game might just eliminate your free time altogether.\u201d -Pocket Gamer\n\n\u201cWe spent way more time than we bargained for with a near-final build as we got sucked into its intricacies, but we\u2019ve managed to tear our thumbs away from the touchscreen long enough to write up some impressions.\u201d -iFanzine.com\n\nYour sister's shabby tavern is facing a takeover by a rich restaurant owner, Gustav. The only way to save it is to become the most popular place in town! \n\n-Adventure the World to Find Ingredients!\n-Slice Up Monsters For Your Main Dish!\n-Fish & Farm for Exotic Produce!\n-Grow your revenue, complete quests, and win contests to rank up your bar!\n\n\n●Story\nKamerina's Bar is a typical tavern in the world of an RPG where adventurers gather to share information.

Gustav is a powerful man, if you don't do anything, he will drive you out of business and force you to sell the bar! Best way to defend the take over?  WIN THE CROWD! Become the most popular bar in town, so even Gustav can't touch you!\n\n●Game Play\n- Slice Up Monsters for Your Main Dish!\nBattles are the best way to get exotic ingredients.
