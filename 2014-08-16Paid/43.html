"description":"NEW CASTLE LEVEL JUST ADDED! The wildly popular NINJUMP has quadrupled in size in NINJUMP DELUXE! This new version adds three new levels, along with the original, to extend your ninja climbing fun and to further test your dexterity.\n\nAlong with the classic NINJUMP level, new Castle, Pirate, and Jungle levels have been added to create a a whole new NINJUMP experience. It is still a fast paced ninja climbing game, where your goal is to rise as high as you possibly can.
