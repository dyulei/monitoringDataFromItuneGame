"description":"! WARNING ! - Due to the game's high speed and advanced graphics, you must have at least an iPad 2, iPhone 4s or 5th gen iPod touch to play!\n\nCult of Mac - 5/5 | Pocket Gamer - 9/10 | Stuff Magazine - 5/5 | AppSpy - 5/5\n\nWe love table tennis!  We also love games with beautiful graphics, longevity and insane challenges - so we made Table Tennis Touch, the most advanced table tennis game on the App Store. \n\nWork your way up from a rookie to the table tennis World Champion in our epic Career mode.  Win tournaments, throwdowns and crazy mini-games and you'll soon see your skills progress until you're ready to take on the master of spin, Kao Jianjun!\n\nWatch the trailer at www.tabletennistouch.com and see why Table Tennis Touch has been the Number 1 sports game in over 90 countries!\n\n_________________________\n\nCult of Mac \n\"It\u2019s easily the best table tennis game I\u2019ve ever played ... If you don\u2019t like table tennis, this game may convert you. It\u2019s that good.\" \n\nPocket Gamer \n\"I\u2019m pretty sure I'm developing a sports injury from playing too much Table Tennis Touch.\"\n\nThe Sunday Times\n\"...will leave your heart pounding and your fingers twitching.\"\n\nThe Guardian\n\"...one of those games you think you'll just dip into every so often, but find yourself playing compulsively on the sofa.\"\n\n_________________________\n\nIn-app purchases: \nOur game has two in-app purchases available but neither is required to complete the game. They may add more fun but certainly aren't necessary to win. \n\nUniversal: \nWe've made Table Tennis Touch universal: buy once and play on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch! Your career progress will be shared across all your iCloud devices. \n\nAbout us: \nWe're just two guys who love table tennis and awesome games. You can read more about us on our website: \nwww.tabletennistouch.com \n\nJoin us: \nwww.facebook.com/TableTennisTouch \nwww.twitter.com/TableTennisTch \nwww.tabletennistouch.com \n\nQuestions or feedback? \nwiffwaff@tabletennistouch.com \n\nOlder devices: \nWe're very sorry but if you have an iPad 1, iPhone 4 or iPod touch 4th gen (or older) we simply can't make Table Tennis Touch run smoothly on your device. We tried really hard but the game play suffered. Table Tennis Touch will not play on these older devices so please do not buy.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "体育", "模拟游戏", "体育"], "genreIds":["6014", "7016", "7015", "6004"], "releaseDate":"2014-05-15T07:00:00Z", "sellerName":"Yakuto Limited", "bundleId":"uk.co.yakuto.TableTennisTouch", "trackId":860620713, "trackName":"Table Tennis Touch", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "minimumOsVersion":"6.0", "formattedPrice":"¥25.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"Table Tennis Touch", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/table-tennis-touch/id860620713?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a733.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple4/v4/8a/cb/5f/8acb5fc3-31c5-49bd-1f94-2a850b6ebbd8/mzl.xlbkdsvi.png", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"251982920", "sellerUrl":"http://www.tabletennistouch.com", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.0, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":29, "trackContentRating":"4+", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":29}]
