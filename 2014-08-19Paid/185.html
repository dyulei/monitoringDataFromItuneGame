"description":"FOR IPHONE4 AND IPOD4 WITH RETINA DISPLAY ONLY, this is the most compact and powerful X-Plane we have ever created. We have combined the airplanes from X-Plane Racing, Airliner, Extreme, Helicopter, Glider, and more from the iPod, iPhone, and iPad into ONE app. X-Plane HDEF-4G has all the resolution and power and graphics of the iPad compressed onto the 4. This, coupled with the code being optimized for the iphone 4 processor and graphics, results in a more tightly detailed and hi-speed app than we have ever seen for any mobile platform... ever.\n\nWith aircraft carriers, air combat, F-22, B-1, B-2, X-15, SR-71, A-380, Boeing 787, and countless more airplanes all represented with accurate flight dynamics, and over a dozen flying areas, and near-infinite weather conditions available, the power of this app is simply mind-boggling.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "教育", "赛车游戏", "模拟游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6017", "7013", "7015"], "releaseDate":"2010-07-10T03:17:13Z", "sellerName":"Laminar Research", "bundleId":"com.laminar-research.X-Plane-4G", "trackId":380872432, "trackName":"X-Plane HDEF-4G", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"Wide-screen support for the iPhone-5 and iPod-5 line of products!", "minimumOsVersion":"5.0", "formattedPrice":"¥68.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"X-Plane HDEF-4G", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/x-plane-hdef-4g/id380872432?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a322.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/a1/a7/e9/a1a7e9bd-aa64-3bea-8e2f-b99e34144b69/mzl.iwpdvirc.jpg", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"158880426", "sellerUrl":"http://www.X-Plane.com", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":8, "trackContentRating":"4+", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":39}]
