"description":"\"Art so beautiful it could have been lifted from a Miyazaki movie.\" \u2013WIRED \n\nAutumn is coming. Leaves fall, and spirits rise from the fallen leaves to begin their journey home. You must guide them, without direct control, by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions - build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it's up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal. \n\n\n◆◆◆◆◆ REVIEWS ◆◆◆◆◆\n\n\"Striking art and innovative gameplay\" \n\u2013The Escapist\n\n\"Spirits is clever, challenging, and beautiful\" \n\u2013Gamasutra\n\n\"Spirits is an outstanding blend of puzzle and strategy\" \n\u2013DIYgamer\n\n\"The overall design -- graphics, animation, audio tracks -- as well as the whimsical element of soaring on the wind, really make this an enjoyable title to experience\" \n\u2013TouchArcade \n\n\"Gorgeous visuals; ambient music; solid level design\" \n\u2013Slide To Play\n\n\"Where Spirits really innovates is in its look and feel. When the wind physics start to do their thing, the experience is pretty magical\" \n\u2013TUAW, Mike Schramm\n\n\"Spirits is more than just a pretty face, as you'll utilize little creatures to build ladders, dig tunnels, or blow gusts of wind to get their counterparts to an exit. It's similar to what we've seen in Lemmings or Downstream Panic, but the use of wind and the diverse puzzles keep things fresh and interesting\" \n\u2013GamesRadar\n\n\"Relaxing, stunning, and simple will keep players coming back for more\" \n\u2013148Apps \n\n\"Visually, the game is gorgeous.
