"description":"Ever wanted to be a hacker?\n\nGreat fun! - I just finished Hack RUN, what a great game! I'm a big fan of interactive fiction and this is a wonderful example of how the genre can be expanded and still be current.\n \nBRILLIANT - This game is innovative, clever and a HUGE breath of fresh air...\n\nThis is AWESOME!!! - This game us so cool that I stopped texting my girlfriend to play it haha :P\n\nHack your way into the heart of a mysterious organization to uncover their secrets. Hack RUN® is a game which uses 'old school' command prompts (like DOS or UNIX) that simulate a real operating system. Learn the commands of each system to help you navigate through your adventure. \n\nAs you hack into their systems, you will learn about the organization and the people who work there. Read files and emails to find clues and riddles which will give you access to more accounts. Data found on their systems will help you learn about the motives of the organization, and how dark their plans can get. You may also discover dirty little secrets about the employees as well. \n\nHacking into new accounts or discovering key information will increase your skill level. As you achieve your goals, you will move closer and closer to the final achievement; over 50 levels deep! \n\nIt's time for a Hack RUN! \n\nGAME CENTER SUPPORT: Earn achievements and compare your leaderboard score against other players.\n\nIf you own the free version of Hack RUN, note that this full version is AD FREE.\n\nStuck on a level? Just use the 'hint' or 'answer' commands to help you along. \n\n=====================================\nMake sure to play the SECOND, THIRD and FOURTH games in this series called Hack Run ZERO, Hack Time and Hack NET after you complete this game!\n=====================================\n\nGreat news! Hack RUN® has been featured in the App Store! We are thrilled Apple has given us this honor, and we hope you enjoy it as much as they do! \n\nHack RUN® is a game. It is not a tool or aid for learning how to hack into real computer systems. i273, LLC does not endorse hacking.", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "娱乐", "智力游戏", "策略游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6016", "7012", "7017"], "releaseDate":"2011-04-07T18:16:03Z", "sellerName":"i273, LLC", "bundleId":"hackrun", "trackId":407678003, "trackName":"Hack RUN", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"> Support for latest OS\n> Added ITC languages\n> Misc bug/typo fixes", "minimumOsVersion":"4.3", "formattedPrice":"¥12.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"Hack RUN", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"3785092", "sellerUrl":"http://www.i273.com", "contentAdvisoryRating":"12+", "averageUserRatingForCurrentVersion":4.5, "userRatingCountForCurrentVersion":54, "artworkUrl100":"http://a665.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple/v4/d6/59/c8/d659c84f-c638-dca7-d087-5f090c82dd09/mzl.xaimzqzq.png", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/hack-run/id407678003?mt=8&uo=4", "trackContentRating":"12+", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":213}]
