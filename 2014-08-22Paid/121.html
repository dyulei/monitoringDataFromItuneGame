"description":"Planet of Cubes is the first true MMO block building game with one global infinite world. \n\nThe whole single and beautiful Planet made of cubes is shared among all multiplayer users online worldwide! \nAncient castles and cathedrals, lost ships and aircrafts, flying islands, cities and megalopolises, military basis, Egyptian pyramids, epic monuments and many other exciting objects and places are waiting for your exploration in this infinite Planet.\n\nThe game has compass and current coordinates display to make navigation through the endless infinite world easier. You can also chat with all players who are visible within your current “View Distance” range. \n\nIn this version of the game each change you make has its lifetime (Time To Live or TTL). When you put or remove block this change is rolled back after some period of time (TTL). The farther you are from the Spawn Zone the longer your changes will last. The average lifetime of a change is displayed at the top of the screen as the TTL indicator. \n\nYou cannot build or dig inside the Spawn Zone. All cubes inside the Spawn Zone have TTL value of 0. Thus to build something make sure to leave Spawn Zone where TTL indicator is greater than 0.\n\nMake sure to select your own skin from 20+ available skins. You will have random skin assigned upon your first login to the Planet. \n\nPlanet of Cubes game gives you infinite number of possibilities and endless potential for all of your creative, constructional and survival needs. \n\nFEATURES:\n\n•One global infinite Planet made of cubes available to all users across the world\n•Unlimited amount of players worldwide\n•Endless amount of beautiful buildings and places made of cubes to explore\n•Built-in chat in Multiplayer mode\n•More than 20 player skins available\n•Works over Wi-Fi and 3G\n•No need to setup and/or host a server\n•No subscription or additional fees required \n•Unlimited use", "currency":"CNY", "genres":["游戏", "娱乐", "探险游戏", "模拟游戏"], "genreIds":["6014", "6016", "7002", "7015"], "releaseDate":"2014-04-08T13:50:28Z", "sellerName":"SolverLabs LLC", "bundleId":"com.solverlabs.poc", "trackId":836670421, "trackName":"Planet of Cubes - MMO block building sandbox", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "releaseNotes":"- multiplayer performance optimizations\n- 3D graphics improvements \n- minor bug fixes", "minimumOsVersion":"6.0", "formattedPrice":"¥6.00", "wrapperType":"software", "trackCensoredName":"Planet of Cubes - MMO block building sandbox", "trackViewUrl":"https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/planet-cubes-mmo-block-building/id836670421?mt=8&uo=4", "contentAdvisoryRating":"4+", "artworkUrl100":"http://a1191.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/ba/df/78/badf7816-8e19-df0c-87d0-50c721a6a68e/mzl.wnsdhgyf.png", "languageCodesISO2A":["EN"], "fileSizeBytes":"39760469", "sellerUrl":"http://poc.solverlabs.com/", "trackContentRating":"4+"}]
